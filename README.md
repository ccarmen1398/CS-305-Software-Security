# CS-305-Software-Security
This project contains the program and assignment I made for certificate generation, hash function implementation, and dependency-check report creation.

1) Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a company that wanted to build software applications to suit their clients' financial organizational needs. Their products needed to contain security properties that protects their clients' data and can adhere to government and cooperate regulations.

2) What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
The main thing I feel I did well with assisting my client's needs and by addressing the most secure cipher algorithm that suits their needs for their diverse products. Providing code security is important with not only protecting user's personal data from attackers, but as enhancing the quality of the product for potential buyers. Contributing to secure attributes and features for a software application creates a standing reputation for a company by highlighting their priorities, such as the safety of their clients.

3) Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The most challenging part of this course was understanding and implementing the hash function for the assignments. Taking a string and implementing it into a formula to generate a hash encryption for data protection was a task that took the most out of my time. The troubles I had with this actually taught me other lessons to better enhance my coding environment, like creating a Java Home path and maven Linux commands for more accurate troubleshooting.


4) How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
In this project, I used many different security layers to better protect the program, such as: creating certs, implementing a hashing algorithm, and updating my programs libraries to alleviate from vulnerabilities.

5) How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
Adding a dependency check plugin into the pom.xml file in the program and running a maven install configuration allowed me to create a webpage of all my program's vulnerabilities. This webpage gave me information on the number of vulnerabilities my program was proposing, and creating any changes to better alleviate from these vulnerabilities could be proven effective my initializing a new dependency check and reviewing if any of the previous flagged vulnerabilities are no longer being reported.

6) What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I honestly just googled topics and any information on my assignments to better understand what was being asked of me and how I could effectively implement these requirements. My favorite thing from this class was figuring out how to install maven commands on my Linux terminal to more effectively run and clean my program.

7)Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I might show my newly found skills of implementing a diverse amount of security types for software programs. Due to the lessons in this class, I was able to learn how to create and install user certificates, a hash function for encrypting data, and a dependency check report to review possible security violations.
